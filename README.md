# Hotel Booking App
__JavaScript Mini Project: Many-To-Many Implementation__ <br>
In this project, a hotel booking application is created using several technology stacks which can be described as follows: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (DBMS), Sequelize (ORM), and EJS (Template Engine using Bootstrap Framework) as the server side rendering view. This project aims to explore more about many-to-many database relationships. The database relationships created in this project can be seen in the ERD.
